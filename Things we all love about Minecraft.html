<center><h1><b>Things we all love about Minecraft</b></h1>
<p>We all know about Minecraft, a sandbox game that is know for it's open world features and aspects. Millions and billions of people play Minecraft worldwide. It is one of the top three most selling games in the world, thus making it one of the most popular game. There are several factors that ended up serving as the causes of its popularity, especially in the present. So here are some factors that sreve as causes of minecrafts popularity:</p>
<h2><b><u>5: Multiplayer</u></b></h1>

<ul><li><p>While many games don't have multiplayer survices, Minecraft fulfills this demand without any downgrades. Minecraft has a friendly multiplayer enviroment encouraging players to play and enjoy with their friends, and we all know, two is better than one, and Minecraft players know how enjoyable it is to play with friends.</p><p>Another aspect of multiplayer Minecraft is 'servers'. Thousands of people from all over the world can gather and play together in servers, renowned ones are Hypixel and Pixelmon. Various minigames can be played together, providing a lot of fun than just playing alone.</p></li><ul>
<h2><b><u>4: Activeness on Several Platforms</u></b></h1>

<ul><li><p>One major reason for Minecraft's popularity is its activeness. Minecraft has its own channels and profiles on different platforms such as YouTube, Twitch and Twitter, which all post different content based on the game. Many content creators and gamers are also reason for Minecraft's popularity, many of them reviving Minecraft from its'dark ages' in 2019. Many Minecraft players may got to knew about Minecraft through these content creators and gamers only, which states us the crucial role played by these creators in development of Minecraft Community.</p><p>Minecraft also has its own website, which provide us latest news and informations about Minecraft and also a mean of signing into Minecraft. Mob votes can also be conducted on Minecraft.net, which we will talk about later.</p></li></ul>

<h2><b><u>3: Not have a Fixed Story</u></b></h1>

<ul><li><p>Many games focus on their stories(can't provide examples, there are thousands of them), encouraging players to move forward on a straight path, which can be implemented in a good way, but it will have an end somewhere and it won't let players show their creativity or explore much, causing a boredom. Though, this isn't the case with Minecraft. Minecraft isn't a story based game and has no straight path. Its player's choice what he wants, and he can do literally anything he wants and show his creativity.</p><p>Now many people will argue that "killing the ender dragon counts as beating the game", which also true, but its ultimately player's choice what he wants rather than being a crucial part of game. Plus, Minecraft also has Creative Mode, in which players can access all resources at once, and it has literally nothing to do with survival. These factors help players show their creativity and also how much game-mechanics they know.</p></li></ul>
<h2><b><u>2: Community 'Togetherness'</u></b></h2>

<ul><li><p>Minecraft has a large community and fandom worldwide, making it one of the most popular video game in the world. So, its Mojang's responsibility to fulfill demands of its community, does by interacting with the community itself. It can be done through various ways. One is Minecraft Live(formely known as Minecon), annual events telling about upcoming updates and spin-offs. Whole Minecraft Community come together on a same platform to watch Minecraft Live and get informed for future. Players also have advantage of live chat to talk with each other, which feels like 'whole community together'.</p><p>Another mode of interaction is Annual Mob Vote(though being an indirect mode). Its an election , specifically for upcoming mobs in Minecraft. Out of three, one mob is voted and elected by players to be added into the game in next update. This is a way to know player's choices and also make player part of the game, not just for playing, but for understanding his choices.</p><p>We also have various servers(discussed above) that let players play togetherserving crucial part for community and multiplayer Minecraft.</p></li></ul>
<h2><b><u>1: Endlessness</u></b></h2>

<ul><li><p>We all knew this coming. Minecraft is one of the most renowned open world game, almost endless(though its actual limit is 6 million blocks radius). Players can explore infinitely, with 'infinite wonder and endless possibilities', in all 3 dimensions, wether its Overworld, Nether or The End. This also keep players motivated to explore more and more, defining key aspect of Minecraft that being exploration. Along with exploration come different structures that generate along them. These structures provide tons of exclusive resoursec and various activities such as building, crafting, and combating, that keep players enthusiastic while looting and exploring these structures.</p><p>Another reflection of endlessness are the updates that come along. These updates bring tons of new features(such as structures, biomes, mobs, etc.) into the game, providing new terrain, items and more features that players can explore in the game, keeping them enthusiastic and motivated to explore till the end, sorry, Minecraft don't have any end.</p></li></ul><br>
<p>Overall, Minecraft is a great game that provide players a ton of features to explore and activities to do. All the aformentioned points sum up together to make Minecraft a great game, a one of its kind.</p></center>
